# JNecessary

About
------
JNecessary is a largely Maths framework designed to make your math based operations quicker and use less memory than the current
Java Maths packages.

Currently even though this project is stable use of this project in large scale software is not recommened as it may cause some unknown erorrs.

Planned Additions
------------
Here some of the things that we at ArczoDev are planning to add are:
 - Finished Fractions based maths
 - Improved rounding
 - More Encryption classes (e.g. Class for all AES based encryption)
 - Maths Interpreter (this may be another project depending on the complexity of this)
 - Prime Number Math

If you would like to suggest some features then feel free to send the creator of the framework an email at jon@arczo.com

Current Features
-------------
 - Imperial to Metric or Metric to Imperial conversion
 - Geometry maths
 - Basic Fraction Math (incomplete)
 - Faster calculations of things such as square root and powers (compared to the standard Java maths framework)
 - MD5 Hash Creation

How to use

If you would like to import this framework into your code then you will need to take these steps for the following IDEs

Eclipse:
 - Drag the compiled jar into your project and place it in a folder such as res or something along those lines.
